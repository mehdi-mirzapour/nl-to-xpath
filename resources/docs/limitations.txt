Fine-tuning the model with some problematic cases. 
https://docs.mistral.ai/guides/finetuning/

Assumptions each command in each line
Postediting is not enabled yet
User will not make it everything proper further pre-processing might be needed. 
Calling models with long sentences create the change to more hallucinations. 
Logging is not enabled due to time limitation.
The agent is static not dynamic (like langgraph), should be upgraded 
automatic json output is not enabled for mistral in langchain to prevent hallucination

prints should be repaced to loggers

BIG Challenge for Evaluation: Dynamic Page Change

It works well with mistral also

Web browsers and Playwright aren’t "smart" — they need precise instructions like:

python
Copy
Edit
page.locator('input[name="email"]').fill("me@example.com")
They can’t interpret:

"Type my email into the login box"

"Hover over 'ok' under 'Employee' section"
